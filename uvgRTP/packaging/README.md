# Packaging

Packaging enables creating distributable versions of uvgRTP for various platforms. 

First, you must build uvgRTP using the [build instructions](../BUILDING.md). After building, you can create the packets by running the ```cpack``` command in ```build``` folder. On Windows, you need to install NSIS from [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/) before running CPack. The downloaded installer may prompt you about unknown program, but it should be safe to install.
